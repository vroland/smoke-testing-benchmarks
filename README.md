# Benchmarks for "Smoke Testing using Answer Set Programming"

In this repository, you will find ASP instances for the benchmarks conducted in the paper.
These instances contain action definitions and their dependencies, not the encoding itself.

Instances belong to one of four benchmark families: linear (*sequential*), parallel chains, tree (*tree-structured*) and random (*mixed*).
The `random` instances are randomly generated and do not share the same seed with the benchmark system utilized in the paper.
